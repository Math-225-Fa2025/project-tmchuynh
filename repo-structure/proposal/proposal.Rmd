## 1. Introduction

This project will examine the illegal trade in tiger parts and its consequences for biodiversity, human communities, and public health.
I will build a country–year panel (2010–2024) that integrates seizure data (TRAFFIC), reported trade (CITES), wholesale price indices/ranges (UNODC/WJC), wild population context (IUCN/national sources), and socioeconomic/governance indicators (WDI/WGI).
Using this panel, I will quantify trends in tiger-part seizures, test whether prior wholesale price signals are associated with subsequent enforcement pressure, and map geographic hot spots.
I will place these signals alongside wild vs. ex-situ (zoo/facility) population snapshots to contextualize conservation status and extinction risk.

To understand drivers and consequences, I will estimate transparent, association-focused models: fixed-effects OLS and Negative Binomial count models for seizures (with per-capita scaling and robust/clustered errors), generalized additive models to capture potential nonlinearity, and beta regression for the live-animal trade share as a spillover-risk proxy.
I will examine links between poverty, services, and governance and recorded poaching pressure; overlay major policy/enforcement events on regional time series; and compile a concise timeline of historic subspecies/population losses and recent country-level functional extirpations.
Because wildlife loss directly affects local economies, I will add a site-level ecotourism module (e.g., a tiger-reserve valuation anchor) and run simple “what-if” scenarios (10–30% drop in sightings) to illustrate potential revenue and job losses that can push communities toward illegal activity.

My outputs will include a clean, documented dataset; policy-ready visualizations (F1–F16: trends, hot spots, price–pressure associations, socioeconomic correlations, live-trade risk indicators, extinction timelines, and economic scenarios); and a concise report highlighting implications for conservation finance, sustainable employment, reputational risk, and public-health prevention.
Throughout, I will be explicit about limits: seizures are detection-biased; population figures carry uncertainty; and all statistical relationships are associational, not causal.
My goal is a reproducible, decision-useful evidence base that supports interventions pairing livelihoods and governance with targeted enforcement and demand reduction.

### 1.1 Scope

-   Focal taxon: *Panthera tigris* (tigers).
-   Spatial unit: country (aggregate to sub-regions where needed).
-   Temporal scope: 2010–2024 (or longest consistent overlap across sources).

## 2. Objectives

1.  **Trade/Enforcement:** Quantify and visualize tiger-part seizure trends over time and geography; compare item types (skins, bones, teeth/claws).
2.  **Prices (carefully handled):** Use vetted **wholesale price ranges/indices** to explore whether market signals correlate with recorded pressure (seizures).
3.  **Populations:** Contextualize trends with **wild population** estimates and, where access permits, **ex-situ** counts (snapshot).
4.  **Extinctions:** Document historic subspecies/population extinctions and recent country-level functional extirpations, acknowledging multiple interacting drivers.
5.  **Socioeconomics & Governance:** Test associations between poverty, governance, and recorded poaching pressure; articulate the **dependency cycle** of illegal income.
6.  **Public Health:** Highlight how unregulated live-animal trade elevates **spillover risk** and burdens human health systems.

## 3. Research Questions and Hypotheses

-   **Q1 Trends/where:** How have tiger-part seizures changed over time and where are hot spots?\
    **H1:** Seizures show clustered hot spots and non-linear trends driven by enforcement and market dynamics.
-   **Q2 Prices → pressure:** Do **wholesale** price indices/ranges align with subsequent changes in seizures?\
    **H2:** Higher prior-year wholesale indices correlate with higher current seizures (association, not causal proof).
-   **Q3 Populations:** How do trade/enforcement trends relate to **wild** population context and (if available) **ex-situ** counts?\
    **H3:** Areas with historically depleted wild populations show weaker elasticity of seizures to price signals (fewer animals to poach), but trafficking routes persist.
-   **Q4 Extinctions:** What does the subspecies/population extinction timeline indicate about illegal trade alongside habitat/prey loss?\
    **H4:** Extirpation events coincide with periods of high poaching pressure and weak governance, with habitat/prey loss as interacting drivers.
-   **Q5 Socioeconomics/governance:** Are poverty, unemployment, basic services, and governance associated with recorded poaching pressure?\
    **H5:** Higher poverty and weaker rule-of-law align with higher seizures per capita.
-   **Q6 Public-health risk (live trade):** Where live-animal seizures occur, do indicators suggest elevated spillover risk?\
    **H6:** Higher shares of live-trade seizures co-occur with weaker services/governance.
-   **Q7 Ecotourism & jobs:** What economic losses (revenue/jobs) are implied when tiger sightings/access fall (e.g., from poaching)?\
    **H7:** Reduced sightings/access materially cuts reserve-level revenue and local earnings; at scale, this undermines sustainable employment, reinforcing the poverty–poaching loop.
-   **Q8 Reputation:** Do persistent poaching signals plausibly damage destination brand and cooperation prospects?\
    **H8:** High, sustained illegal trade indicators correlate with reputational risk narratives (qualitative).

## 4. Data Sources (open or requestable)

-   **IUCN Red List (Panthera tigris)** — status, range, best-available global population context.
-   **CITES Trade Database** — official, country-reported international trade in CITES-listed species; filter for *Panthera tigris* and relevant product terms.
-   **TRAFFIC (e.g., “Skin and Bones” series)** — consolidated seizure analyses (counts/weights by year/country/item).
-   **UNODC World Wildlife Crime Reports** — trafficking flows, valuation methods, **wholesale** price ranges/indices (use only as ranges/indices; no granular detail).
-   **Wildlife Justice Commission (WJC)** — carefully collected **wholesale** price intelligence (use as indices/ranges, aggregated by year/region).
-   **Species360 / ZIMS & studbooks** — ex-situ snapshots (access-controlled; use if permission is granted).
-   **Socioeconomics/Governance** — World Bank (WDI), Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI).
-   **Protected areas / habitat context (optional)** — WDPA; forest-loss layers (Global Forest Watch/Hansen).
-   **Public-health (optional, coarse)** — aggregated country-year counts from official reporting where available (used illustratively, not for causal claims).

## 5. Ethics, Risks, and Communication

-   **Purpose:** academic analysis of drivers/impacts; **no operational guidance**.
-   **Prices:** use **wholesale ranges/indices** only; aggregate by year/region; no “how/where” detail.
-   **Bias & uncertainty:** seizures are detection-biased; population estimates are ranges; clearly label all uncertainty.
-   **Framing:** avoid victim-blaming; emphasize structural drivers and solutions (livelihoods, governance, demand reduction, sanitary controls on live trade).
-   **Public-health:** discuss live-trade spillover risk as **associational**; no causal claims beyond evidence.

## 6. Data Analysis Plan

### 6.1 Data Quality & Bias Controls

-   **Harmonize country names/ISO codes**; ensure region mapping for price indices.
-   **Handle missingness** explicitly; document coverage by country–year.
-   **Per-capita and log transforms** for skewed outcomes (seizures).
-   **Detection/reporting bias** acknowledgment: seizures ≠ total illegal activity; enforcement intensity varies.
-   **Population estimates** treated as ranges/snapshots; do *not* fabricate annual series.
-   **Price data** used only as aggregated **wholesale** ranges/indices; no transactional specifics.

### 6.2 Prices → Pressure (associations)

-   Build annual **wholesale indices/ranges** for tiger parts (UNODC/WJC).
-   Explore **lagged** associations (e.g., t-1 price index vs t seizures) via scatter + LOESS and simple OLS/Poisson with year fixed effects.
-   Emphasize **correlation**, not causation; acknowledge reporting/detection bias.
-   **Unit:** region–year (or country aggregated to region for price linkage).
-   **Spec:** $spm_t = α + β * index_mid_{t-1} + γ_t + ε$ (OLS on SPM or GLM on counts with offset log(pop)).
-   **Readout:** sign/CI of β; LOESS overlay.
-   **Note:** associational; robustness with region FE if data permit.

### 6.3 Populations & Extinctions

-   Place seizure trends alongside **wild population** context (global range; country snapshots where credible).
-   **Subspecies/population extinctions**: brief timeline for historic losses (Bali, Javan, Caspian) and recent country-level functional extirpations (e.g., Cambodia, Laos); attribute multiple drivers (poaching/illegal trade, habitat conversion, prey depletion).
-   **Build** a timeline of historic subspecies/population losses and recent country extirpations (e.g., Cambodia, Laos) and **overlay** regional seizure trends.
-   **Interpretation:** structured narrative; do not claim causality.

### 6.4 Socioeconomic Drivers & Dependency Cycle

-   Contrast seizures per million people across **poverty quartiles**.

-   Bivariate plots: poverty, unemployment, basic services, and governance vs **log(1 + seizures per million)**.

-   Light regression (intro level), lagging covariates and adding year fixed effects:

    $$
    \text{Seizures}_{c,t} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Poverty}_{c,t-1} + \beta_2 \text{RuleOfLaw}_{c,t-1} + \beta_3 \text{GDPpc}_{c,t-1} + \gamma_t + \varepsilon_{c,t}
    $$

    Interpret as **associations**; discuss the **dependency cycle** where illegal income becomes self-reinforcing under weak alternatives.

-   **Unit:** country–year.

-   **Alternatives:** Poisson/NegBin for counts with offset(log pop)); quantile regressions for heavy tails.

-   **Readout:** direction, magnitude, and stability across specs.

### 6.5 Live-Trade & Public-Health Risk

-   Calculate `live_share` of seizures; plot trends by region/country.
-   Show `live_share` vs basic-services/governance proxies.
-   Panel with coarse outbreak counts for qualitative discussion of **spillover risk**; no causal claims.
-   **Unit:** country–year (subset where `live_share` observed).
-   **Spec:** $live_share_ct ~ services (water/electricity) + governance + year FE$ (OLS or beta regression if proportions).
-   **Readout:** directional association with services/governance.

### 6.6 Ecotourism Revenue & Jobs

-   **Anchor:** site-level, peer-reviewed valuation (e.g., annual value and local share).
-   **Scenarios:** 10–30% visitation drop → compute **revenue** and **local earnings** losses.
-   **Contextualize:** relate to national/regional wildlife-tourism jobs figures (qualitative framing).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Notes on joins and readiness per figure

-   **By-country figures:** F1–F3, F8–F12 use `country`–`year` (ISO3), with `region` as a cosmetic or grouping field.
-   **By-region figures (price linkage):** F4 requires `country → region` mapping to join `index_mid_lag`. Aggregate seizures to region-year first.
-   **Snapshot/context figures:** F5 (populations) and F13–F14 (tourism anchors) are **not** merged into the panel; keep as separate tables with clear years and caveats.
-   **Event overlays:** F6–F7 add an events table (`event_year`, `event_type`, `geography`) to annotate timelines.

## 10. Ethics & Risk Mitigation

-   **Purpose:** academic analysis of drivers and impacts; **no operational guidance**.
-   **Price handling:** use **aggregated wholesale ranges/indices** from reputable syntheses; **no “how/where” details**.
-   **Price data:** use vetted **wholesale ranges/indices** aggregated by year/region; no procurement detail.
-   **Population estimates:** use latest credible sources; treat as ranges, not annual time series.
-   **Causality:** present associations; avoid over-claiming.
-   **Data access (ex-situ):** document permissions; omit if unavailable.
-   **Attribution:** cite TRAFFIC, CITES, IUCN, UNODC, WJC, and any other sources; respect licenses and access terms (e.g., ZIMS).
-   **Biases:** seizures ≠ total illegal activity; detection and reporting vary widely.
-   **Community framing:** avoid victim-blaming; emphasize **structural drivers** (poverty, governance, market access) and **solutions** (livelihoods, enforcement, demand reduction, health/vet safeguards).
-   **Health claims:** treat any health indicators as **associational**; do not overstate causality.

#### Statistical Tests

**Associations & correlation**

-   **Pearson** (linear) and **Spearman** (rank) between `log_spm` (log(1+seizures per million)) and predictors (`pov_215`, `gdp_ppp_pc`, `rule_of_law`, `index_mid_lag`, `clean_water`/`electricity_access`).
-   **Kendall’s τ** as a robustness check on small-N regional series.

**Group/comparative tests**

-   **t-test** or **Wilcoxon rank-sum** for high- vs low-poverty groups (or governance high vs low) on `log_spm`.
-   **ANOVA** or **Kruskal–Wallis** across poverty/governance **quartiles**, with **Dunn’s test (Holm)** post-hoc if nonparametric.

**Trend & structural change (time series)**

-   **Mann–Kendall** trend test + **Theil–Sen** slope for monotonic trends in yearly global/regional seizures.
-   **Change-point tests** (e.g., **CUSUM** or **Bai–Perron**) on regional seizure or price-index series to flag structural breaks that align with policy events.

**Count-model diagnostics**

-   **Overdispersion test** (Cameron–Trivedi) on Poisson; if present, prefer **Negative Binomial**.
-   **Vuong** (or LR) tests to compare Poisson vs **NB** vs **zero-inflated** variants where zeros are excessive.

**Panel & regression diagnostics**

-   **Breusch–Pagan** (heteroskedasticity); use **HC3** or **cluster-robust** SE if violated.
-   **VIF** for multicollinearity.
-   **Moran’s I** on country-level residuals (spatial autocorrelation check); if present, cluster by region or add spatial controls.
-   **Ramsey RESET** (specification) and residual Q–Q/fit plots for sanity checks.

**Proportions & live-trade**

-   **Two-proportion z-tests** or **χ²** on share of live-animal seizures across periods/regions (if binarized); for continuous `live_share`, rely on regression/β-regression below.

**Multiple comparisons**

-   Control false-discoveries in families of tests with **Benjamini–Hochberg (FDR)**.

**Uncertainty**

-   **Bootstrap CIs** for medians and for model coefficients where asymptotics are weak.

#### Algorithms

**Core models (panel/cross-section)**

-   **OLS with fixed effects**:

    -   `log_spm_ct ~ poverty_{t-1} + rule_of_law_{t-1} + gdp_ppp_pc_{t-1} + year_FE` (country–year panel).
    -   Robust **HC3** or **clustered SE** (by country or region).

-   **GLM for counts** (when modeling raw seizures):

    -   **Poisson / Negative Binomial** with `offset = log(pop)`; choose **NB** if overdispersion; consider **ZINB** if many zeros.

**Nonlinearity & robust effects**

-   **GAM (splines)** for potential curvature in `poverty`, `rule_of_law`, or `index_mid_lag`.
-   **Quantile regression** (e.g., τ = 0.5) to estimate median associations robust to outliers.

**“Price → pressure” association (regional)**

-   Regional aggregation + **lagged regressor**:

    -   `spm_region_t ~ index_mid_{t-1} + year_FE`, OLS with HAC (Newey–West) SE for serial correlation.

-   **LOESS** smoother in scatterplots for visualization (no inference).

**Event/Policy analyses (descriptive, not causal claims)**

-   **Interrupted time series (ITS)** / segmented regression around major policy shocks, with **Newey–West** errors.
-   **Event-study plots** (two-way FE if sample permits) to visualize pre/post patterns; interpret cautiously.

**Live-trade risk modeling**

-   **Beta regression** (or **quasi-binomial**) for `live_share` (0–1), with predictors: services (`clean_water`/`electricity_access`), governance, year FE.

**Spatial sanity**

-   If Moran’s I flags spatial autocorrelation, use **cluster-robust SE by region**, or add **regional FE**; full spatial lag/error models are optional stretch goals.

**Predictive/importance (optional, clearly labeled exploratory)**

-   **Regularized regression** (**LASSO / Elastic Net**) to gauge variable importance among many correlated covariates; k-fold CV for tuning.
-   **Random Forest / Gradient Boosting** to obtain **permutation importance** and **partial dependence** plots; stress **non-causal**, exploratory nature.

**Smoothers & decomposition (EDA)**

-   **STL decomposition** on longer regional series (seizures or price indices) to separate trend/seasonal/irregular components (if periodicity exists).
-   **Theil–Sen** lines on bivariate plots as robust trend depiction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Reporting discipline**

-   Always report: model formula, unit of analysis, N, SE type (HC3 / clustered / HAC), goodness-of-fit (AIC/BIC or pseudo-R²), and key coefficient estimates with 95% CIs.
-   Clearly label all **associations** as non-causal; tie interpretations back to biases (detection, reporting) and uncertainty in population and price data.
